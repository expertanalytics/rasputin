# Rasputin

Rasputin can convert a point set of `(x, y, z)` coordinates to a triangulated
irregular network. Specifically, it has been developed to convert raster dems
(digital elevation models) into simplified triangulated surface meshes. The
`rasputin_triangulate` program can read `GeoTIFF` files and construct surface
meshes in various formats.

It is also possible to compute the shade cast from a given, planar sun ray
vector. This shade is computed based on the cell center of the simplified
surface mesh.

## Implementation strategy

The heavy lifting in Rasputin is done by external software:
 * [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) is used for triangulation and simplification 
   routines. 
 * [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used to generate 
   the Python wrappers.
 * [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) is used to read 
   [GeoTIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF) files.
 * [Meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) is used to write results.

## Installation

Installing Rasputin is easy, as the C++ dependencies are header only. Simply
download and unpack the source code for `pybind11` and `CGAL` and place them
under the `lib` directory using the names `pybind11` and `CGAL`, respectively.

As of November 2018, the latest release of `pybind11` generates quite a lot of deprecation warnings for Python3.7. In this case, pulling the source directly from the master branch at github is recommended:
```
cd <rasputin_directory>/lib
git clone git@github.com:pybind/pybind11.git
```

Alternatively, use the latest released sources:
```
cd <rasputin_directory>/lib
wget https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/archive/v2.2.3.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/releases%2FCGAL-4.13/CGAL-4.13.tar.xz
tar xf v2.2.3.tar.gz && mv pybind11-2.2.3 pybind11
tar xf CGAL-4.13.tar.xz && mv CGAL-4.13 CGAL
```

CGAL requires the two libraries [GMP](http://gmplib.org/) and
[MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/) to be installed in order to work satisfactory. On
Ubuntu, these libraries can be installed the usual way by typing

```
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
```

or for Arch:
```
sudo pacman -Syy gmp mpfr
```

in a terminal window. Also, CGAL depends on [Boost](https://www.boost.org/),
see [here](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html#title21).

Additionally, you need Python 3, a modern compiler supporting C++17, and CMake.
Then, to install Rasputin, change to the Rasputin root source directory and run
```
pip3 install .
```
Or, if you prefer the old style:
```
python3 setup.py install
```


## Minimal Example
To test the installation run this for example in ipython:

```
from rasputin import triangulate_dem

vs = triangulate_dem.PointVector([(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,0), (0.25,0.25,1)])
points, faces = triangulate_dem.lindstrom_turk_by_ratio(vs, 2.0)
for f in faces:
   print(f)
```

This should print out:
```
>> (3, 1, 2)
>> (0, 1, 3)
>> (0, 3, 2)
```
Congratulations! You just triangulated a small mountain.

## Data

The Rasputin `GeoTIFF` data reader has only been used on one file, and hence,
should not be expected to work on a wide variety of files. However, this data
set can be downloaded
[here](http://blog.mastermaps.com/2016/09/creating-tin-from-raster-dem.html).
This data file is quite large, covering a 60km by 60km raster of the largest
Norwegian mountain range Jotunheimen using 6000 times 6000 raster points.
Hence, processing the whole file takes quite some time. See the manual for the
`rasputin_triangulate` for help regarding only triangulating parts of this
raster.
