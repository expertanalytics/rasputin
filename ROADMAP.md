# Rasputin Roadmap

 * Implement a simple off-reader, such that we can work with existing TINs.
 * Implement a file format for storing sun ray positions and the corresponding
   utc time.
 * Implement a script the reads a mesh in off-format and sun ray
   positions, and computes the corresponding shaded triangles.
